# Map Generator

A C++ psuedo game called *Generic Space Game*. I wanted to make a game resembling [FTL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/212680/FTL_Faster_Than_Light/?l=english), especially the map of space that the player can explore.

The game has 3 aspects aspects to it. A world map, divided into sector of various nature. A local map made up of nodes that represent locations the player can visit. And a "battle" state where the player has to click on ennemies to get rid of them.

The part that I was mainly interested in was the node graphs and generating a map avvording to specific rules.
